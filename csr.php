            <p class="mt-3">Way for Life has always used corporate volunteering
                engagement as one of its tools to execute the programmes. The past year has not been any different! Working by its main mantra – development, the organisation has engaged in more than 185 events in cities like Bangalore,Hyderabad and Mumbai and collaborated with numerous local and global NGOs to accelerate the betterment of government schools, which also are they key focus for the organisation when it comes to development. The organisation’s engagement with around 25-30 corporate clients in the year makes it very clear, that corporate volunteering engagement is what capacitates it to undertake the numerous projects. Apart from working for the development of government schools, Way for Life also collaborated with around 25 other NGOs to work on community problems during the year and helped several other organisations in better implementation of their
                plans
