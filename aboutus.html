                    <b> Way for Life </b> 
                     is a registered, youth-driven NGO, based in Bengaluru, Karnataka, founded in the year 2017. The footsteps of our approaches to community development and environmental sustenance have been ideated and undertaken by the energetic body of youth volunteers who write our story through reshaping yours. What our action survives and thrives on is sustained by the dynamism of considerate, passionate young volunteers whose outlook on life aligns with ours! The desire to uplift the marginalized sections of the society, coupled with an equal emphasis on commonly neglected issues such as Blood requirements, Relief programs, and educational and environmental issues have comprised the major activities which Way for Life engages in. Our most referenced contribution to the field of Social Service is usually our involvement and intervention programs with Government schools. Our assistance varies from reconnecting the broken dots on the walls of these schools to coloring the very same structures - through the supply of physical equipment, the labor, and the selfless voluntary teachers who transform the lives of the innocent day-dreamers into problem-solvers and goal-achievers. 
                    <br>
                    The issues which our organization seeks to impact a positive change in are limitless – hence, the open-ended usage of the word ‘Life’ in its name. Owing to this interest and determination to involve and serve ourselves in whatever is the need of the hour, Way for Life is functional in 7 cities across India, namely: Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai and Delhi and tackles a multitude of issues pertinent and peculiar to these cities. Way for Life, through its 200+ events and recurring activities in the past few years, has strived to take actions that result in long-lasting positive changes to whoever the beneficiaries may have been, and whatever issues that we have attempted to placate. A wayward life is not the most beneficial way forward. Our steps taken collectively as an NGO for the past few years have been an ascension in the livelihoods of not only our beneficiaries but our volunteers and partners too. Providing each of these souls involved in the action an ability to not only hope for a better future but actually seeing it to fruition is an assurance that our work is one that is leading our nation in the right direction. Our challenges are endless, but our determination is boundless too. Together, we have and we shall continue to overcome whatever obstacles stand in our efforts in paving the way for better lives.

                                The spark for the idea of Way for Life came about after three like-minded classmates were exposed and eventually astonished by the massive discrepancy that existed between an underprivileged student who studied in a Government school and a student in a Private school. The obvious financial imbalance that both of the students came from, coupled with the lack (almost an absolute absence) of even the most necessary infrastructure in the Government schools greatly affected the comfort and naivety of our founders. This inequality, they resolved, was one that required immediate correction.
                                Way for Life started off in 2017 with 3 members  and the support of a few local retailers in Bangalore. Witnessing a steady growth of support and participation from onlookers soon after the very 1st event instilled in the members then not only the confidence to proceed with their actions, but also a conviction that what they were putting their collective efforts into would soon blossom into fruition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To appease the obvious, seemingly unending depreciation which our Indian education system is a perpetrator of – which leaves with it an innumerable number of destitute, student victims who lack the resources and knowledge of a way to move forward – Way for Life’s main motives are centralised towards correcting this flaw in the system. By instilling a greater efficiency in the transference and exchange of knowledge and improving the infrastructure in Government schools, Way for Life is confident that these small steps will make student-hood a ‘learning experience’ and not simply a ‘test’ of one’s memory.
                                The activities have not been restricted to this field alone in the 3 years since our inception. With our functioning in 7 cities across India, our 6000+ volunteer body is constantly working on ways to improve the constantly changing political, social, environmental scenarios in our country, by directing our efforts towards issues and communities which are regularly neglected.

                          <p>Plantree strives to solve the root-cause of our environmental problem – the dearth of greenery! The plantation of an innumerable number of seed-balls along the lake beds of Ooty and the parks of Bandipur and Coorg has been induced each time this event has been conducted. This simple and feasible method of mass sowing of seeds has provided a sustainable rectification to our primary environmental problem. Our previous Plantree events have successfully planted over 3,00,000 seed balls and our most successful session witnessed a total of 1,00,000 seed balls planted in one day.

                            <p>Entree gives volunteers and attendees from various organisations a hands-on master class on making pens out of paper! A proclivity to upcycling is an attitude we strongly encourage in the Government Schools and Shelter Homes we work for. Entree workshops are also conducted in corporate spaces, as a collaborative initiative with their CSR projects. Whatever creatively-reused produce that is generated is delivered back to our children in Shelter Homes. An example of what is taught in these workshops is the reusing of the plastic refill –which is converted into a seed-holder and then planted in a plastic vase, made out of a discarded plastic bottle. As evident from this, these workshops aim to reduce our dependence on plastic usage in our everyday, essential dealings while simultaneously inspiring creative habits which are harmless to Nature.</p>

                            <p>Reusing an unwanted material to serve another purpose is always welcomed as it reduces waste generation. With ‘Green Bottle’, we ‘upcycle’ or ‘creatively reuse’ unwanted plastic bottles, by transforming this discarded scrap into a useful plate – an essential item that can now be used for multiple purposes instead of polluting the environment. This choice of our products – ‘plastic bottles’ and ‘plates’ – has been done intentionally, in order to exemplify the normality and productivity in upcycling the items we use daily.

                                Plantree 2.0 is a developed model of our own event with the same name. This initiative implements the Miyawaki Method of afforestation. A pledge had been taken on World Environment Day 2020 that in a year’s time, Way for Life would have planted 365 saplings; on account of the dense and fast paced growth of tree cover assured with this method (with the minimal time of necessary maintenance), we are confident that with the attainment of this 12-month goal of ours, a substantial contribution to the atmosphere would have been made by our collective efforts. Plantree 2.0 plans to beautify the physical spaces surrounding the Government Schools and Shelter Homes by enhancing their livelihood with this necessary supply of organic, enriching greenery!

                            <p>‘Notebook Upcycling’ brings new meaning to the saying that ‘one man’s trash is a treasure for another’. We are guilty of throwing away notebooks which still have pages which have remained untouched. This event makes new notebooks with these unused pages from rejected notebooks as well as reusing other recycled paper. The notebooks produced are then distributed to eager learners in Shelter Homes and thereby instil an attitude of distributing our surplus to the needy. This endeavour attempts to not only undo the hazard caused by careless paper disposal, but also demonstrate the simplicity of reusing and recycling. We also acquire recycled paper for the sections in the notebooks which require a firmer density. </p>
