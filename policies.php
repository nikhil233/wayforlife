                    <li>Some services on our website use multi-session cookies, also known as persistent cookies.  Persistent cookies are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Small bits of text temporarily stored in your computer.</li>

                    <p>Persistent cookies placed on the computer will expire two years after your last visit to our website. Data collected through persistent cookies will be retained by the specific FDA office associated with the website using the cookie.</p>
                    
                  </ol>
                  <li><b><u>HYPERLINKING POLICY</u></b></li>
                  <i><p>A sample from mygov.in:</p>
                  <p>At many places on MyGov, you shall find links to other websites/portals. These links have been placed for your convenience. MyGov is not responsible for the contents of the linked websites and does not necessarily endorse the views expressed in them.

                  <li><b><u>DISCLAIMER POLICY</u></b></li>
                  <p>Indicates a site owner is not responsible for advice or information and limits liability. If your site includes content of a technical or legal nature, this is a must-have policy. Interestingly enough, this is one of the policies you’ll often find embedded into individual page alongside the respective content in addition to a general policy page or section.</p>
